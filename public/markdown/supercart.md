# Supercart

*Disclaimer: This project is for entertainment value only.*

I created an Android bot that could automatically accept high-value delivery orders on the Instacart Shoppers app. As an Instacart shopper, you have the ability to choose what orders to accept. However, most high-value orders (usually because the order has lots of items, has lots of heavy items (such as water), or best of all, has lots of tip) get taken by other shoppers within seconds. As a shopper, you either have to spend time on the app waiting for a high-value order to appear, or accept the low-value pending orders that most shoppers do not like to take.

Longer description coming soon!
